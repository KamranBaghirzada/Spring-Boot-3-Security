# Spring-Boot-3-Security
This project demonstrates JWT token-based authentication using Spring Boot 3 and Spring Security 6, 
highlighting the evolution of authentication mechanisms and seeking collaborative insights for improvement.


**About the Project:**
This project is like a learning adventure for me in Spring Security.
I've had some experience with Spring before, but this time I wanted to explore the latest stuff â€“ Spring Boot 3 and Spring Security 6.
It's been a mix of learning and doing things on my own, and I'm really proud of how far I've come.

**Used Tech:** JDK (17),Build tool - Maven.
**Used libraries:** Spring WEB (RESTFUL architecture), Spring Data Jpa, PostgreSQL, Lombok, Spring Security, Jsonwebtoken.

**Spring Security:**
The cool thing about this project is that it helps you see how Spring Security has changed in the new version.
Think of it like a puzzle where the pieces have shifted a bit.
I'm focusing on the names and labels that have changed, and it's pretty fascinating.
This gives us a sneak peek into how Spring Security has evolved over time.



**For attention:**

While I've been steering this ship solo, I'm not shy about asking for help. I've taken inspiration from other smart folks who've done similar things. 
But I'm not here to just show off my work; I'm all ears for what others have to say. 
If you spot something that could be done better or you have a tip to share, I'm all ears. This is a journey we're all on together, and 
I believe in the power of learning from each other. 
**Thanks for attention!**
